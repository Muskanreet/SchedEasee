#SCHEDULE APPOINTMENT SYSTEM
CASE STUDY: SCHEDEASE
Team Members: Muskan Sharma and Idowu
This project involves designing and implementing an appointment scheduling system called Schedease using C#. This system will allow users to schedule, view, update, and manage appointments in a streamlined manner. Here's an overview of how the system would work and its key components:
OVERVIEW OF SCHEDEASE
1.	User Authentication:
Users must register and log in to use the system.
Role-based access allows for different permissions, such as "Admin" or "User."
2.	Core Functionality:
Scheduling Appointments: Users can choose a date, time, and purpose for their appointments.
Viewing Appointments: Users can view all their upcoming appointments in a list or calendar format.
Updating Appointments: Users can modify appointment details, such as changing the time or purpose.
Canceling Appointments: Users can delete appointments they no longer need.
3.	Calendar Integration: A calendar view will help users immediately see their appointments for a day, week, or month.
4.	Error Handling and Validation: The system will prevent scheduling conflicts (e.g., double-booking) and handle invalid inputs.
5.	Data Persistence: The system will use a database (e.g., SQLite or SQL Server) to store user information and appointment data. 
6.	User Interface (UI): A simple, user-friendly UI using Windows Forms or WPF, allowing users to interact with the system seamlessly.
7.	Additional Features (Optional):Reminders: The system can send reminders (via email or SMS) about upcoming appointments.
8.	Admin Dashboard: An admin could manage appointments for multiple users.




Technical Structure
•	Front-end: The UI will be built using Windows Forms or WPF in C#, providing forms for login, registration, appointment scheduling, and viewing.
•	Back-end: The system will use SQL to manage data. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) handle the lifecycle of appointments.
•	Database: Tables for users and appointments will be designed to store and manage records efficiently.
•	Logic Layer: The core logic will validate input, check for scheduling conflicts, and process user actions like creating or updating appointments.
By following this structure, Schedease will be a robust, user-friendly system for managing appointments efficiently.
